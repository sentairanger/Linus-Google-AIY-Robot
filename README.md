# Linus-Google-AIY-Robot
This is a project where I created a robot based on voice control using the Google-AIY voice kit V2

## Intro
Hello, this is a project that took me (on and off) two years to complete due to frustration and dead ends. However, I was recently able to get things running and now I am happy to present this project to you all. This is a project that I really wanted to accomplish in order to further my understanding of AI, machine learning and robotics. 

## Note
Here's some things I had to take into consideration:

* The Google Voice Assistant is now depreciated so in order to get it working I had to use the command `pip3 install google-voice-assistant==1.0.0`.
* The Apache License header was added to some of the code to comply with it because even though you can modify it, you must respect the license. In this case, I kept the header in tact but added a few lines to indicate that I had modified the code, and gave the date of when I modified the code. This is important to comply with the license.
* To use the Voice kit, you'll need a 2.1 amp power supply as that is required to power the voice bonnet. 
* The Cloudspeech API changed to the Cloud Speech to Text API so make sure you take that into consideration as well.

## Dedication
This project is dedicated to the wonderful Mr. Paul F. Cain. He was my AP Physics teacher and my High Q coach. He helped me when I was bullied in school and recruited me for High Q when I was senior. He listened to me, guided me and believed in me. Unfortunately, I've made many mistakes that almost cost me my life and for years felt that I had disappointed him. That feeling got worse when he died 2 years ago. I started this project because of him and as much as I thought I had failed him I had to keep going for him. I am glad I didn't give up and I can finally dedicate this to him as he was my biggest inspiration.

## Getting Started
To get things started here is what I needed to set things up:

* Google AIY Voice Kit V 2.0
